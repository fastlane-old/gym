# What's gym?

`gym` builds and packages iOS apps for you. It takes care of all the heavy lifting and makes it super easy to generate a signed `ipa` file :muscle:

`gym` is a replacement for [shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen).

### Before `gym`

```
xcodebuild clean archive -archivePath build/MyApp \
                         -scheme MyApp
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
           -exportFormat ipa \
           -archivePath "build/MyApp.xcarchive" \
           -exportPath "build/MyApp.ipa" \
           -exportProvisioningProfile "ProvisioningProfileName" 
```

### With `gym`

```
gym
```

### Why `gym`?

`gym` uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application which results in much faster build times.

              |  Gym Features
--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
:rocket:            | `gym` builds 30% faster than other build tools like [shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen)
:checkered_flag: | Beautiful inline build output
:book:     | Helps you resolve common build errors like code signing issues
:mountain_cableway: | Sensible defaults: Automatically detect the project, its schemes and more
:link:  | Works perfectly with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) and other tools
:package: | Automatically generates an `ipa` and a compressed `dSYM` file
:bullettrain_side: | Don't remember any complicated build commands, just `gym`
:wrench:  | Easy and dynamic configuration using parameters and environment variables
:floppy_disk:   | Store common build settings in a `Gymfile` 
:outbox_tray: | All archives are stored and accessible in the Xcode Organizer
:computer: | Supports both iOS and Mac applications

# Installation

    sudo gem install gym

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Usage

    gym

That's all you need to build your application. If you want more control, here are some available parameters:

    gym --workspace "Example.xcworkspace" --scheme "AppName" --clean

If you need to use a different xcode install, use xcode-select or define DEVELOPER_DIR:

    DEVELOPER_DIR="/Applications/Xcode6.2.app" gym

For a list of all available parameters use

    gym --help

If you run into any issues, use the `verbose` mode to get more information

    gym --verbose

In general, if you run into issues while exporting the archive, try using:

    gym --use_legacy_build_api

Set the right export method if you're not uploading to App Store or TestFlight:

    gym --export_method ad-hoc

To pass boolean parameters make sure to use `gym` like this:

    gym --include_bitcode true --include_symbols false

To access the raw `xcodebuild` output open `~/Library/Logs/gym`

# Gymfile

Since you might want to manually trigger a new build but don't want to specify all the parameters every time, you can store your defaults in a so called `Gymfile`.

Run `gym init` to create a new configuration file. Example:

```ruby
scheme "Example"

sdk "iphoneos9.0"

clean true

output_directory "./build"    # store the ipa in this folder
output_name "MyApp"           # the name of the ipa file
```

## Export options

Since Xcode 7, `gym` is using new Xcode API which allows us to specify export options using `plist` file. By default `gym` creates this file for you and you are able to modify some parameters by using `export_method`, `export_team_id`, `include_symbols` or `include_bitcode`. If you want to have more options, like creating manifest file or app thinning, you can provide your own `plist` file:

```ruby
export_options "./ExportOptions.plist"
```

or you can provide hash of values directly in the `Gymfile`:

```ruby
export_options(
  method: "ad-hoc",
  manifest: {
    appURL: "https://example.com/My App.ipa",
  },
  thinning: "<thin-for-all-variants>"
)
```

For the list of available options run `xcodebuild -help`.

# Automating the whole process

`gym` works great together with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools), which connects all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow. 

Using `fastlane` you can define a configuration like

```ruby
lane :beta do
  xctool
  gym(scheme: "MyApp")
  crashlytics
end
```

You can then easily switch between the beta provider (e.g. `testflight`, `hockey`, `s3` and more).

For more information visit the [fastlane GitHub page](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane).

# How does it work?

`gym` uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application. The 2 main components are 

- `xcodebuild` 
- [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty)

When you run `gym` without the `--silent` mode it will print out every command it executes.

To build the archive `gym` uses the following command:

```
set -o pipefail && \
xcodebuild -scheme 'Example' \
-project './Example.xcodeproj' \
-configuration 'Release' \
-destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
-archivePath '/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive' \
archive | xcpretty
```

After building the archive it is being checked by `gym`. If it's valid, it gets packaged up and signed into an `ipa` file.

`gym` automatically chooses a different packaging method depending on the version of Xcode you're using.

### Xcode 7 and above

```
/usr/bin/xcrun path/to/xcbuild-safe.sh -exportArchive \
-exportOptionsPlist '/tmp/gym_config_1442852529.plist' \
-archivePath '/Users/fkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-09-21/App 2015-09-21 09.21.56.xcarchive' \
-exportPath '/tmp/1442852529'
```

`gym` makes use of the new Xcode 7 API which allows us to specify the export options using a `plist` file. You can find more information about the available options by running `xcodebuild --help`.

Using this method there are no workarounds for WatchKit or Swift required, as it uses the same technique Xcode uses when exporting your binary.

Note: the [xcbuild-safe.sh script](https://github.com/fastlane/gym/tree/master/lib/assets/wrap_xcodebuild/xcbuild-safe.sh) wraps around xcodebuild to workaround some incompatibilities.

### Xcode 6 and below

```
/usr/bin/xcrun /path/to/PackageApplication4Gym -v \
'/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive/Products/Applications/name.app' -o \
'/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName.ipa' \ 
--sign "identity" --embed "provProfile"
```

Note: the official PackageApplication script is replaced by a custom PackageApplication4Gym script. This script is obtained by applying a [set of patches](https://github.com/fastlane/gym/tree/master/lib/assets/package_application_patches) on the fly to fix some known issues in the official Xcode PackageApplication script.

Afterwards the `ipa` file is moved to the output folder. The `dSYM` file is compressed and moved to the output folder as well.
