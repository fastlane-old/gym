# What's gym?

`gym` builds and packages iOS apps for you. It takes care of all the heavy lifting and makes it super easy to generate a signed `ipa` file :muscle:

`gym` is a replacement for [shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen).

### Before `gym`

```
xcodebuild clean archive -archivePath build/MyApp \
                         -scheme MyApp
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
           -exportFormat ipa \
           -archivePath "build/MyApp.xcarchive" \
           -exportPath "build/MyApp.ipa" \
           -exportProvisioningProfile "ProvisioningProfileName" 
```

### With `gym`

```
gym
```

### Why `gym`?

`gym` uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application which results in much faster build times.

              |  Gym Features

# Installation

This tool is still work in progress. You can already try it by cloning the repo and running

    sudo gem install gym

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Usage

    gym

That's all you need to build your application. If you want more control, here are some available parameters:

    gym --workspace "Example.xcworkspace" --scheme "AppName" --clean

If you need to use a different xcode install, use xcode-select or define DEVELOPER_DIR:

    DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode6.2.app gym ....

For a list of all available parameters use

    gym --help

If you run into any issues, use the `verbose` mode to get more information

    gym --verbose

To pass boolean parameters make sure to use `gym` like this:

    gym --upload_bitcode true --upload_symbols true


# Gymfile

Since you might want to manually trigger a new build but don't want to specify all the parameters every time, you can store your defaults in a so called `Gymfile`.

Run `gym init` to create a new configuration file. Example:

```ruby
scheme "Example"

sdk "9.0"

clean true

output_directory "./build"    # store the ipa in this folder
output_name "MyApp"           # the name of the ipa file
```

# Automating the whole process

`gym` works great together with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools), which connects all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow. 

Using `fastlane` you can define a configuration like

```ruby
lane :beta do
  xctool
  gym(scheme: "MyApp")
  crashlytics
end
```

You can then easily switch between the beta provider (e.g. `testflight`, `hockey`, `s3` and more).

For more information visit the [fastlane GitHub page](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane).

# How does it work?

`gym` uses the latest APIs to build and sign your application. The 2 main components are 

- `xcodebuild` 
- [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty)

When you run `gym` without the `--silent` mode it will print out every command it executes.

To build the archive `gym` uses the following command:

```
set -o pipefail && \
xcodebuild -scheme 'Example' \
-project './Example.xcodeproj' \
-configuration 'Release' \
-destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
-archivePath '/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive' \
archive | xcpretty
```


After building the archive it is being checked by `gym`. If it's valid, it gets packaged up and signed into an `ipa` file.

```
/usr/bin/xcrun /path/to/PackageApplication4Gym -v \
'/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName 2015-08-11 18.15.30.xcarchive/Products/Applications/name.app' -o \
'/Users/felixkrause/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2015-08-11/ExampleProductName.ipa' \ 
--sign "identity" --embed "provProfile"
```

Note: the official PackageApplication script is replaced by a custom PackageApplication4Gym script. This script is obtained by applying a [set of patches](https://github.com/fastlane/gym/tree/master/lib/assets/package_application_patches) on the fly to fix some known issues in the official Xcode PackageApplication script.

Afterwards the `ipa` file is moved to the output folder. The `dSYM` file is compressed and moved to the output folder as well.
